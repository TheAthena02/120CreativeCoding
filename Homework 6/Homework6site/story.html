	The machine stumbled down yet another alley, slowly hearing the shouting fade away. The sound was replaced by the dripping of oil from her abdomen onto the asphault and the sparks emminating from exposed wire ends as the bot slumped against the brick wall to her left. Ahead, a dark figure aproached, but as the bot's eyes struggled to focus through the cracked glass of her face, the figure came into light. A tall, slim man with wireframed glasses and a patchy beard looked down with a soft expression towards the shaking machine. He approached slowly, but the bot shuddered and pulled away, hugging the brick. It was clear the damage done to her was from humans, as she looked up in apparent fear of the man in front of her. However, the softness of his expression and body language told her he was not like the men who had just beaten her to pieces. Therefore, she did not flinch nor step away as he came even closer, and she leaned into him as he wrapped his arms around her broken body, pulling her torn breasts against his ragged robes. He turned his head towards her, whispering into the microphone located where an ear would be.<br>
	"This is for your own good, my dear."<br>
	She did not react to this, nor did she flinch as she felt his hand grasp her main power chord at the base where it attached to the back of her metal skull. He removed it cleanly, as it was meant to be removed. She went limp in his arms immediately, her LEDs along her body fading within a second. He held her in his arms for a moment longer, before gently picking her up, placing her tattered body over his shoulder. As he did so, he could feel her oil run down his arm, and he heard metal pieces ping as they bounced on the ground below him. Still, he walked back into the darkness, his face grim as he blinked away a tear.
